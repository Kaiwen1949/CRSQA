# CRSQA Dataset

This repository is to provide the relative tools for the research about 360 omnidirectional stitching images quality assessment.

About the study report, our lab cvteam had published the paper 《Cross-Reference Stitching Quality Assessment for 360 Omnidirectional Images》 on ACM Multimedia 2019.

## Introduction
Cross-Reference Omnidirectional Stitching data Set (CROSS) is a large dataset for 360 omnidirectional images stitching quality assessment.

There is in total 10 senses devided into indoor and outdoor two categories. The dataset is organized as follow:
* Indoor: meeting room, class room, stairs, underground park, dance room, reading-room
* Outdoor: street, wild area, basketball court and residential area.

Each group images are composed by fisheye image and 7 omnidirectional stitching images which are as follow:
<table>
